# Vivino-data-project

Aims:

- learn to code a web scraper in Python for data extraction from Vivino website,
- make a database (perhaps with the help of SQL),
- make a website from scratch using Javascript/HTML/CSS,
- make interesting interactive visualisations of the data on the website, maybe using some machine learning if possible.

Data:

https://www.vivino.com/

Output website:

https://karinaoneill.github.io/vivino-data-project/index.html



Data Extraction - Webscraper:

Use Python
Choose Scrapy over Beautifulsoup, because of the size of the data and Scrapy downloads HTML, which I think i'll need (explain this more).
