# Beer-data-project

I want to:

- learn to code a web scraper in Python,
- make a database (perhaps with the help of SQL),
- make a website from scratch using Javascript/HTML/CSS,
- make interesting interactive visualisations of the data on the website.

Data:

If I decide not to web scrape, here is a pre-made database:
Open beer database (not up-to-date, Feb 2018) - http://openbeerdb.com/

Website:
